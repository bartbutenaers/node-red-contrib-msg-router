# node-red-contrib-msg-router
A Node Red node to route messages between nodes.

This node makes a series of message routing types available in Node-Red, similar to routers in [Akka](http://getakka.net/articles/actors/routers.html).  Note that not all routers types from Akka have been implemented here, because in Node-Red the message router node doesn't get any feedback from the receiver nodes: this means the message router node is not aware of the load of the receiver nodes.

In most cases the **wires** in a Node-Red flow will be sufficient for message routing, since they allow N-to-M connectivity (i.e. N outputs can be connected to M inputs).  In case an output port is connected to N wires, the wiring will pass the *original* message through the first wire (and *clones* of that message through all the other wires):

![Standard wiring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bartbutenaers/node-red-contrib-msg-router/master/images/router_wiring.png)

Some use cases are load balancing, demultiplexing, ...

Remark: in the near future the wiring will become pluggable in Node-Red.  Perhaps some of this node's functionality will become standard available?

## Install
Run the following npm command in your Node-RED user directory (typically ~/.node-red):
```
npm install node-red-contrib-msg-router
```

## Usage
The node can be configured in a few steps, via the node's config screen:

+ When a message needs to be routed to M receiver nodes, then start by adding M outputs.
+ For each output a number of properties can be setup:
    - `Active` : When selected, the router will be able to send messages to that output.  When deselected, the output will be ignored, and the messages will be distributed accross all other (active) outputs.
    - `Clone`: When selected, the router will clone every input message that will be send to this output.
    - `Delay`: When a value is specified (in milliseconds), each message send to this output will be delayed for the specified time period.
    - `Weight`: When a value is specified, the weight indicates the possibility that a message will be send to that output. The weight option will only be available for the 2 weighted router types. Weights can be used to setup outputs with different processing capacities. Outputs with higher weights receive more messages, compared to outputs with less weights.
+ The specified router type will determine how the input messages are being routed to the N available outputs.

## Router types
The router types specifies HOW the input messages will be routed to the M available outputs.

### Broadcast routing
The broadcast router will send the input message to ***all active outputs***. Since the same message is going to be send to multiple outputs, it is important to specify for each output following property:
+ whether the *original* input message should be send.
+ whether a *clone* of the input message should be send.

```
When the load should be distributed across time, a *delay* can be specified for each output.  Otherwise the message will arrive at all ports at the same time:

Remark: when the router type is 'broadcasting' combined with cloning for all outputs except the first one, the behaviour of this node will be identical to standard Node-Red wires.

### Message based routing
The message based router will send the input message to the output, which is specified inside the message itself.  Each message needs to have a `msg.output` field, which contains the output number (from 1 to N).

Remark: this type of routing can e.g. be used to create some kind of ON/OFF switch:

### Random routing
The random router will send the input message to one randomly chosen output.

![Random timeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bartbutenaers/node-red-contrib-msg-router/master/images/router_timeline_random.png)

### Round Robin routing
The Round Robin router will send the input message to the next output, in a sequential order.  Suppose we have N outputs:
+ The 1-st message will be send to output 1
+ The 2-th message will be send to output 2
+ ...
+ The n-th message will be send to output N
+ The (n+1)-th message will again be send to ouput 1
+ ...

So as soon as all outputs have received a message, the cycle starts all over again at the first output ...

![Round Robin timeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bartbutenaers/node-red-contrib-msg-router/master/images/router_timeline_round_robin.png)

This router type can be setup as ***topic dependent***, which means that each `msg.topic` will get its own sequence.  For example the next message for topic A will be send to output 5, while the next message for topic B will be send to output 2.</p>

### Weighted Round Robin routing
Same mechanism as a normal Round Robin routing, but the weighted Round Robin router allows each port to have a ***weight***.  A weight is an integer value that defines the processing capacity of that output: outputs with heigher weight will receive more messages (since they should have enough processing capacity), compared to outputs with less weight.

Watch out: weights with value 0 can result in issues, so it is adviced to disable such outputs instead.

### Consistent hashing routing
The consistent hashing router will send all input messages with the ***same value*** (hashed) to the same output port.  Any field of the input message can be specified to contain the hash key.  And any object can be used as a key, but usually a string or number or unique id (guid) will be used.

This can be used to group similar (i.e. with same value for a specified msg field) messages by output

### Weighted consistent hashing routing
Same mechanism as a normal consistent hashing routing, but the weighted consistent hashing router allows each port to have a ***weight***.  A weight is an integer value that defines the processing capacity of that output: outputs with heigher weight will receive more messages (since they should have enough processing capacity), compared to outputs with less weight.

Watch out: weights with value 0 can result in issues, so it is adviced to disable such outputs instead.

## Cloning
Each port can be configured to retrieve the original input message, or a clone of it.

When an output port is connected to multiple input ports, the standard Node-Red wiring will send the original message to only 1 input.  All the other inputs will get a clone of the message.  That is a very obvious design design, to avoid multiple nodes manipulating the same message (which might result in strange behaviour).  

However in some cases cloning should be avoided, especially when lot's of data is involved.  For example when the messages contain images, unnecessary cloning of messages will result in bad ***performance***.  If the images are being send to N image *manipulation* nodes, cloning will be required.  But when the images are being send to N image *analyzing* nodes (that don't manipulate the message content), it will be much faster to send the original message to those nodes.

## Delays
A delay can be specified (in milliseconds) for every output.  These delays can be used by all router types.  When a message arrives on an output, it will be delayed with the interval specified for that output.

When N delay values have been specified, it is possible to apply relations between those separate values:
+ The delay values can be **unrelated** to each other, which means each output get its own delay.  E.g. when all 3 outputs for 'broadcasting' have a delay 100, they will all get a message after 100 ms.  

   ![Unrelated mixed delay](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bartbutenaers/node-red-contrib-msg-router/master/images/router_timeline_delay_unrelated.png)

+ The delay values of **all outputs can be incremented**, which means that the delay of an output N is the sum of the delays of *all* outputs with a lower output number.  E.g. when all 3 outputs have a delay 100, the message will be delayed 100 msec for output 1 and 200 msec for output 2 and 300 msec for output 3.  The delay for output3 will stay 300 msec even when output 2 becomes inactive.

   ![All active delays](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bartbutenaers/node-red-contrib-msg-router/master/images/router_timeline_delay_all.png)

+ The delay values of **all active outputs can be incremented**, which means that the delay of an output N is the sum of the delays of *all active* outputs with a lower output number.  E.g. when all 3 outputs have a delay 100 (but output 2 is inactive), the message will be delayed 100 msec for output 1 and 200 msec for output 3.

   ![All active delays](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bartbutenaers/node-red-contrib-msg-router/master/images/router_timeline_delay_active.png)

The advantage of ***'unrelated'*** delays is that a lower output number can get its messages faster compared to a higher output number:

## Output control via messages
When this option is enabled, the outputs can be configured using input messages.  When an input message has a `msg.output` field, the same message *can* contain extra fields to configure that output:
+ `msg.active` This field can override the *'Active'* value of this output.
+ `msg.weigth` This field can override the *'Weigth'* value of this output.
+ `msg.clone` This field can override the *'Clone'* value of this output.

As soon as the message contains at least one of these 3 latter fields, the message is considered as a **control message**.  Such messages are only used to configure an output, but are ***not*** routed to the outputs!  

Notice that this updated configuration is not reflected in the node's config screen, since that screen contains the default configuration.
